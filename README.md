# SIM4: Analogue Voltage Simulator

This app was created to aid me in my daily tasks. It connects to an OMEGA box with 15 AV outputs and 8 DIG outputs.
The outputs are physically connected to inputs on an engine control unit (and dash) on my bench.
Using this app I can send voltages to these inputs at 0.001V precision. I use it to simulate Engine Speed, Throttle pedal and servo, miscellaneous temperature and pressure sensors and much more.
At work we use a physical board with rotating dials for this, so this completely replaces that.

#TODO: Refactor app and implement best practice OO
This was one of my first apps, so the code is not very clean. It needs a complete refactor

#TODO: Add remembering user state to App.config
In progress. Almost finished.
